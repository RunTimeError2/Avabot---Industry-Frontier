## MIT理念

······一开始似乎理解错了...

#### making the world a better place

A passion for difficult problems. And a strong desire to `do good for society`. 

From the very beginning, MIT has been a magnificent human machine for inventing the future: not an ivory tower, but a `laboratory` for brilliant minds geared to tackling `real-world problems and answering the biggest questions`. We open our doors to the most talented people on the planet, no matter their origins, and we position them for impact.

In a sense, MIT’s greatest invention may be itself — an unusual concentration of unusual talent, forever reinventing itself on a mission to make a better world. That invention is powered by individuals: `a global community of educators, researchers, and learners with different perspectives but a shared commitment to serving humanity.`

We have a record of `transforming society for the better`—and we are just getting started. As we look to the horizon, we see a future of important challenges and inspiring opportunities. With your help, we can build a better world.

Since MIT was founded to help a young nation seize its future as an industrial powerhouse, the people of MIT have been busy solving hard problems and answering big questions, and they have left society transformed. Today, everyone at MIT is `hacking societal problems`. And we see humanity’s pressing global challenges as invitations to action.

### emmm

MIT’s community is defined by its values: `Excellence`. Meritocracy. **Boldness. Humility. Curiosity.** 

revolutionary: learning, reasearch...

At MIT, we focus on `inventing the future`. We push past` the edges of human understanding`. We make `new ways of seeing, and we see new ways of making`. 

As we look to the horizon, we see a future where `fundamental science` unlocks vital new knowledge and unleashes unprecedented innovation…where `climate change` yields to climate action…where `clean energy` is as universal as the sunrise…where every member of the human family can count on `clean water` and nourishing food…where `smart citie`s inspire wise communities, and the digitally daring drive bold advances for humanity…where we converge on ways to `detect disease` before it has symptoms, to reduce cancer to an inconvenience, and to make a vaccine for HIV as routine and effective as a tetanus shot…where Alzheimer’s itself is just a memory…where new `nano-everything` solves old, enormous problems…where `good ideas don’t languish in the lab but flourish in the marketplace`…where daring companies of every size create thriving industries and achieve lasting progress…where prosperity is measured not in dollars alone but in the currency of art, culture, and understanding…where quality education is radically more available and massively more effective…and where we offer the world’s undiscovered talent a digital path to a creative future.

## mind and hand 

MIT people are eager to know `how things work — and inspired to make them work better`. Our “[mind and hand](http://www.mit.edu/about/#mission)” philosophy spurs `real-world engagement`, and thanks to MIT’s `entrepreneurial `culture, Greater Boston’s innovation ecosystem brims with companies spun out from MIT. We also embrace` collaborations with [industry(opens in new window)](http://ilp.mit.edu/) and government`, as we `seek compelling problems` where MIT innovation can make an impact.

MIT’s motto is “mens et manus,” or “`mind and hand,`” signifying the fusion of academic knowledge with practical purpose.

By helping MIT inventors connect with mentors, collaborators, networks, and funding, we help them translate new science into transformative innovation. MIT entrepreneurs make a sizable global impact: **The active companies** formed by living MIT alumni produce estimated annual revenues on par with the gross domestic product of the [10th-largest economy in the world(opens in new window)](http://web.mit.edu/innovate/entrepreneurship2015.pdf).

## MIT media lab

### intro

**The combination of computing and communication,** as we know it now and can expect it to evolve in the decades ahead, will vastly **expand human creative capacity**

 Over the years, examples have ranged from a sensing system developed for magicians Penn and Teller that became the basis for a life-saving, baby-seat sensing device for automobiles;to electronic ink enabling e-readers; to a new generation of digital interfaces; tosuccessful commercial ventures such as The Echo Nest, Bluefin Labs, and Formlabs.



### inventing the future，antidisciplinary culture

#### business collaboration

**pdf: a unique perspective**

 Yet it is often too easy to become internally focused, losing
sight of key sources for inspiration, customer needs, and changing marketplaces,thus stifling creativity and long-term growth.
The MIT Media Lab is a unique resource to `help companies address these issues` via its facilities and faculty.

At first glance, much of the Media Lab’s research may seem tangential to current business realities, but for more than 30 years, the Lab has demonstrated that seemingly “farout” research can find its way into the `most conventional—and useful—applications. `

use of a single new technology, or the convergence of `several
technologies.` Many members use the Media Lab to build business connections and specifically to collaborate with downstream partners, which can enable them to come to market with a more complete product. Plus, connections with Media Lab start-ups provide a rich source of ongoing technology and product development.

`collaboration`

`funding`The Media Lab is supported by more than 80 members, including some of the world’s leading organizations. Our members provide the majority of the Lab’s approximately $75 million annual operating budget, and their businesses range from electronics to entertainment, fashion to health care, and toys to telecommunications.

Today’s conventional prosthetic limbs do not provide feedback to the nervous system. Because of this, people with amputated limbs cannot **feel** the position, speed, and torque of their prosthetic joints without looking at them, making it difficult to control their movement. In order to create a more complete prosthetic control experience, researchers at the Center for Extreme Bionics at the MIT Media Lab invented the **agonist-antagonist myoneural interface (AMI)**. The AMI is a method to restore proprioception to persons with amputation.
